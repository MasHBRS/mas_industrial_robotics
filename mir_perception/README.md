# MIR Object Recognition ROS2 Code Base

## Features impelemented

* Multimodal object recognition node as a Lifecycle node.
* A universal lifecycle controller node.
* Composition of nodes.
* Dynamic paramter reconfiguration using rqt_reconfigure for runtime manipulation of parameters.
* Integrated RGB Object recogntion using YOLOv5 from [b-it-bots](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_industrial_robotics/pull/257).

> Note: The code is only tested with the RGB recognition. The depth recognition is not tested due to the lack of 3D object recognition models.


## Environmental setup

> Note: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS(Focal Fossa) is recommended for this codebase to work.

## Steps to run the mmor component:

> Note: Make sure to source the ROS rolling and devel in all the terminals

**Step 0:**
* Navigate to the worskpace directory and source the ROS and workspace in all the terminals.
```
cd ~/mir_object_recognition
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Step 1:**

* If using a realsense camera, connect the camera to your system where you are running this codebase and run the following command in terminal 1:
```
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true pointcloud.ordered_pc:=true depth_module.profile:=640x480x30 rgb_camera.profile:=640x480x30
```
* The `ros2-beta` branch of `realsense2_camera` package has a bug that doesn't set the `pointcloud.ordered_pc` parameter to true. So, we have to set it manually using the `ros2 param` command.
```
ros2 param set /camera pointcloud.ordered_pc true
```
* To align the pointcloud depth properly, set the below parameter to true.
```
ros2 param set /camera align_depth.enable true
```

Or

* If running in the simulation, run the bag file in loop in terminal 1 using the command below:
```
ros2 bag play -l bag_files/bag_file_name
```
* If you dont have the bag file, download one from the below link and save it in `~/mir_object_recognition/bag_files`:
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1okPBwca5MgtF6kc3yL3oOEA8TWGFyu-0/view
```

**Note:**
* In order for the object recognition to work properly, the RGB image and the Pointcloud data should be of same size and in sync.

* If you want to collect a bag file and use if for later, use the following command in terminal to record the bag file with the required topics:
```
ros2 bag record /camera/color/camera_info /camera/color/image_raw /camera/depth/color/points /clock /tf /tf_static
```

**Step 2:**
* If you are using a realsense camera, you have to publish the tf link between the camera and the base_link in another terminal:
```
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0.298 -0.039 0.795 0.0 1.16 -0.055  base_link camera_link
```
* Change the tf values according to your camera setup.

**Step 3:**

* Run the multimodal_object_recognition launch file in terminal 2 using the command below (make sure to source your workspace).
```
ros2 launch mir_object_recognition multimodal_object_recognition.launch.py 
```
* Once the node is launch is up and running, move to next step.

**Step 4:**
* Run the rqt_reconfigure to dynamically change parameters via gui in terminal 3 using the command below:
```
ros2 run rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```
* Click 'Enter' after chaning any input field values.


**Step 5:**

* Run the lifecycle_controller in terminal 4 using the command below.

```
ros2 run lifecycle_controller lifecycle_controller --ros-args -p lc_name:=mmor
```
* lifecycle_controller needs the lifecycle node name as a parameter to run. 
* Here, we are passing `mmor` for our multimodal_object_recognition (mmor) node.

* To know more about how to use the lifecycle controller, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/HBRS-SDP/ss22-ros2-perception/wiki#lifecycle_controller-node).

**Step 6:**

* Run the RGB recognizer script in terminal 5 using the command below:
```
ros2 launch mir_recognizer_scripts rgb_recognizer.launch.py
```

**Step 7:**
* Run the rviz2 to view the object recognition output and other relevant data in terminal 6 using the command below:
```
rviz2
```
* Once the rviz is open, load the `~/mir_object_recognition/src/mir_object_recognition/ros/rviz/mir_object_recognition.rviz` file to view the recognized objects and their poses.

**Step 8:**

To perform RGB object recognition, follow the steps below:
   
* The mmor node will be in unconfigured state by default.
* Change the state to Inactive by entering `C` in the `lifecycle_controller` terminal, during which all the parameters, publishers, subscribers and other configurations take place.
* Refresh the `rqt_reconfigure` gui to see the updated parameters.
* To start processing the data, change the `mmor` node state to Active by entering `A` in the `lifecycle_controller` terminal.
* The `mmor` node then process the image and point cloud data and publishes the recognized objects list, along with their poses and bounding boxes.
* The object recognition from RGB recognizer, bounding boxes and poses from pointcloud can be visualized in `rviz2`.
* To terminate the `mmor` node, enter `X` in the `lifecycle_controller` terminal, which will shut down the node.
* To know more about the process flow of this project, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/HBRS-SDP/ss22-ros2-perception/wiki).

## Steps to run the data collector component:

**Step 1:**

Follow the first step for the MMOR component and run either the bagfile or the realsense node. 

**Step 2:**
In a new terminal with the workspace sourced, run the launch file for the data collector component
```
ros2 launch mir_object_recognition data_collector.launch.py
```

**Step 3:**
In another terminal, run the lifecycle controller node and pass 'data_collector' as the lc_name argument.
```
ros2 run lifecycle_controller lifecycle_controller --ros-args -p lc_name:=data_collector
```

**Step 4:**

Press C to transition the data_collector component from UNCONFIGURED to INACTIVE state, and then press A to transition it to ACTIVE state. 
In this state, the component will start saving the pointcloud clusters and the RGB image. By default, the location is the '/tmp/' directory, 
but if you want to change this, you can provide the desired location as an argument to the launchfile like the following example:
```
ros2 launch mir_object_recognition data_collector.launch.py log_directory:=/home/user/Pictures/
```
